**L-lactate dehydrogenase B chain (LDHB)**, often abbreviated as LDHB, is an enzyme that plays a crucial role in cellular metabolism. It is a subunit of the L-lactate dehydrogenase enzyme, which catalyzes the reversible conversion of pyruvate to L-lactate in a redox reaction. This reaction involves the interconversion of NADH (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, reduced form) and NAD+ (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, oxidized form).

**LDHB** is found in various tissues and cells throughout the body, including muscle, liver, and red blood cells. Its main function is related to anaerobic metabolism, where it helps to regenerate NAD+ by reducing pyruvate to lactate during conditions of low oxygen availability or high energy demand. This process is critical for the continued functioning of cells under anaerobic conditions, such as during intense exercise or in oxygen-deprived tissues.

**LDHB** is an important marker in various clinical settings, as its levels can change in response to different conditions. For example, elevated LDHB levels in the blood may indicate tissue damage, such as in cases of myocardial infarction (heart attack) or certain cancers. Measuring LDHB levels is a useful diagnostic tool and can provide insights into various physiological and pathological processes.

Overall, **LDHB** is a significant enzyme involved in cellular metabolism and has important implications in both normal physiology and disease.
